# dotfiles
very minimal set of dotfiles for your terminal

## installation

0. clone this repo:

   `$ git clone git@github.com:frodosamoa/dotfiles.git`

1. run the `./init.sh` script located in this repository. this adds a few lines to your `~/.bash_profile` which will link together the `.bash_profile` file located in this directory (which makes use of all the scripts located in `/bash`).
this also copies over an `.inputrc` file to your home directory.
